# MagicEyes

Give your code assistant eyes. One command to see everything.

```bash
npx magiceyes
```

## What It Does

MagicEyes lets AI coding assistants see your browser. Click the extension, capture any page, ask Claude "what do you see?"

No screenshots folder. No drag and drop. Just instant visual context.

## Install

```bash
npx magiceyes
```

The setup wizard:
1. Configures Claude automatically
2. Opens Chrome extension install
3. Tests the connection

That's it. 30 seconds.

## How It Works

```
Browser → Extension → MCP Server → Claude
```

Click icon. Capture page. Claude sees it. Done.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rorz/magiceyes.git
cd magiceyes
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```
